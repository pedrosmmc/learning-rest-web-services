Learning REST Web Services

This project consists of a simple RESTful Web service for learning purposes and to expose my knowledge.

The project is a backend service to manage basic blog, where we have users who make posts and comments on posts.

It was built using JavaEE 12 using the Spring framework (Spring Boot, Spring, Spring Starter Web, Spring MVC, Spring Security), and managed by Maven.

It is a level 3 project on the Richard Maturity Model scale where resources are exposed in proper URI (eg http: localhost: 8080 / users / 3331 / posts / 4441 / comments / 5551), using the correct HTTP methods for each request-response communication, and HATEAOS data are included in each response.
